        <h1>Smooth Operator</h1>
        <h2>by Sade</h2>
        <p>
          He's laughing with another girl</br>
          And playing with another heart</br>
          Placing high stakes making hearts ache</br>
          He's loved in seven languages</br>
          Diamond nights and ruby lights high in the sky</br>
          Heaven help him when he falls</br>
          Diamond life, lover boy</br>
          We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy</br>
          City lights and business nights</br>
          When you require streetcar desire for higher heights</br>
          No place for beginners or sensitive hearts</br>
          When sentiment is left to chance</br>
          No place to be ending but somewhere to start</br>
          No need to ask</br>
          He's a smooth operator</br>
          Smooth operator</br>
          Smooth operator</br>
          Smooth operator</br>
          Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male</br>
          Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale</br>
